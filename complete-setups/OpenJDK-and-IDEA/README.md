# Complete OpenJDK + IDEA setup

[These OpenJDK + IDEA combination images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?tab=packages&repo_name=spaces-images&q=OpenJDK+IDEA)
provide complete OpenJDK + IDEA development environments (IDE, CLIs, settings, etc.),
which should enable most OpenJDK developers to be productive in itopia Spaces
without requiring customization (by administrators) or personalization (by developers).
