# Complete setup for all runtimes and all IDEs

[This all-in-one image](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?tab=packages&repo_name=spaces-images&q=all+runtimes+IDEs)
provides a hyper-complete development environment that contains
(the latest supported versions of) all supported runtimes and all supported IDEs.
We do not recommend using such a bloated environment for day-to-day work,
but this image is useful for demonstrating everything you can do inside itopia Spaces.
